# Introduction

This package provide **fast** and **accurate** machine learning models for biochemical applications.
Especially, we support very high-dimensional models with sparse inputs, *e.g.*, millions of features and millions of compounds.

# Installation

SparseChem depends on **pytorch**, which you have to install first, other dependencies will be installed with the package:

```
pip install -e .
```
